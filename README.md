ABSTRACT

The aim of this project is to build a application that helps people take care of their elders health. Elders tend to forget their appointments and do not take medicines on time. This negligence can have very harmful effects on their health. In Indian society, we like to take care of our elders, but in this busy world, we may not be  present every time to remind our parents or elders to take care of themselves and maintain  a record of their health. This application  helps to keep a record of their vitals such as weights, height , blood pressure and temperature. It also  helps  to schedule appointment reminders and remind  elders with a msg when the appointment is scheduled. It also enables people to remind their elders about their medicines and their timings. It keeps record of their  symptoms, doctors and clinics and present their vitals in a form of charts.

CONCLUSION  AND FUTUREWORK




In the future we will restructure the database and make the system more independent. We will allow different users to use the application for different elders. We will implement alexa voice skill assistance to support elders queries. Implement profile and reports page to help the caretakers store reports in the form of pdfs and provide a personalize experience. We will also add doctor login in the project so that authorized doctors can view the details of the patients.
